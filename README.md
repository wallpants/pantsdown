# Pantsdown

Pantsdown is a **Markdown** to **"GitHub HTML"** converter based on [Marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked).
Basically this is a non customizable version of Marked, optimized to render markdown similar to how GitHub does it plus
some features developed specifically for [github-preview.nvim](https://github.com/wallpants/github-preview.nvim).

Applicable fixes/updates released by Marked will eventually be applied to Pantsdown.

If you need a feature that's supported by GitHub and is not already listed in Pantsdown's [Roadmap](#roadmap),
feel free to open an issue. If you need anything else, use Marked or another library.

## Installation

ðŸš¨ Pantsdown is distributed only as a TypeScript module. This means you'll need a bundler to handle transpilation.
See below for usage examples.

```sh
bun install pantsdown
```

## Usage

### [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project)

Create a Vite Project & install dependencies:

```sh
bun create vite my-app --template react-swc-ts
cd my-app
bun install pantsdown
```

Remove CSS from `my-app/src/main.tsx`:

```diff
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App.tsx'
- import './index.css'

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
)
```

Replace content in `my-app/src/App.tsx`:

```tsx
import { Pantsdown } from "pantsdown";
import "pantsdown/styles.css";
import { useEffect } from "react";

const pantsdown = new Pantsdown();

function App() {
    useEffect(() => {
        const markdown = "# Hello world\n- [ ] item 1\n- [ ] item 2";
        const html = pantsdown.parse(markdown);
        const container = document.getElementById("markdown-container");
        if (container) container.innerHTML = html;
    }, []);

    return <div id="markdown-container" className="pantsdown light" />;
}

export default App;
```

## Roadmap
